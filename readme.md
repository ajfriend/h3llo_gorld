# "Hello World" for `h3-go`

(If you've never used `go` before.)


## Get `go`ing

First we'll get a basic Go example running (without `h3-go`).

We'll try this example: https://gobyexample.com/values

On my Mac:

```
brew install go
```

Create the `values.go` file as in the example (also included here),
and then run:

```
go run values.go
```
